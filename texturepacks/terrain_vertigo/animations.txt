# This file defines the animations used in a texture pack for ClassiCube.
# Each line is in the format : <TileX> <TileY> <FrameX> <FrameY> <Frame size> <Frames count> <Tick delay>
# - TileX and TileY are the coordinates of the tile in terrain.png that will be replaced by the animation frames.
#     Essentially, TileX and TileY are the remainder and quotient of an ID in F10 menu divided by 16
#     For instance, obsidian texture(37) has TileX of 5, and TileY of 2
# - FrameX and FrameY are the pixel coordinates of the first animation frame in animations.png.
# - Frame Size is the size in pixels of an animation frame.
# - Frames count is the number of used frames.  The first frame is located at
#     (FrameX, FrameY), the second one at (FrameX + FrameSize, FrameY) and so on.
# - Tick delay is the number of ticks a frame doesn't change. For instance, delay of 0
#     means that the tile would be replaced every tick, while delay of 2 means
#     'replace with frame 1, don't change frame, don't change frame, replace with frame 2'.
# NOTE: If a file called 'uselavaanim' is in the texture pack, the game instead generates the lava texture animation.
# NOTE: If a file called 'usewateranim' is in the texture pack, the game instead generates the water texture animation.
